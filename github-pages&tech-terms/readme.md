#Deploying to Github Pages 

As a finishing touch for this week we will discuss how to make your work available online. Afterall, a website is not a website if no one can see it. 

We will use a mechanism for this that is provided by github called 'pages'.

##Git / Github Review

####Git Init

Initializes a repository for version control by git.

####Git Add `filename.txt or -A`

Adds all new files and changes ready for a commit

####Git Commit -m "helpful, descriptive message"

Takes a snapshot of the current state

#### Git Remote Add Origin `remote URL`

Connects local and remote repositories

#### Git Push Origin Master

Syncs remote with Local

##Github pages

Once your repo is up to date, assuming you have an index.html in the root directory of your project:

1. Click on the Settings tab and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. 


2. Then select the master branch source and click on the Save button.

3. visit : http://username.github.io/repository to view your webpage!
